In all url we can see ?page query argement is used for display the correct content. Let's try to explore the directory,...

?page=../../ We got "Wrong.."

Tried a lot and I try ?page=../../../../../../../etc/ which give me "You can DO it !!!  :]"

Into the url, use this query ?page=../../../../../../../etc/passwd

This will be display /etc/passpwd file

Resolution :
    Block page query to only existing page and not enable to open file directly like that.
