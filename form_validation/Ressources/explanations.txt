When we go to the "survey" page, we can see a form when multiple select inputs.

Select inputs display option between 1-10, editing some of they and the form will submit a POST request with two inputs "sujet" and "valeur" (valeur is the edited field)

Try to send the post value with "valeur" different than allowed values (more than 10, the form must check if the field is numeric) with a curl request

curl 'http://192.168.1.140:8080/index.php?page=survey' --data-raw 'sujet=2&valeur=11' | grep flag

And we got the flat :)

You must protect your form, don't trust any user!
