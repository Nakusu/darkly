In precedent breach (sql_injection_1) we got an username "GetThe" and firstname Flag (try members id 5)

On the login page we seen any limitation about post request (not captcha, cooldown)

Let's try to brute force it!

Download a passwords list -> https://github.com/duyet/bruteforce-database/blob/master/1000000-password-seclists.txt

Launch the python script, it will try all of the list :)

The password is "shadow"

We got the flag ;)

Add a ratelimite or a captcha on the login page and don't use that king of password
