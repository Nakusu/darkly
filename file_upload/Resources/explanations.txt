When we click on the button "Add a image" we are redirect on the page upload.

Let's try to upload some image, png not work, svg not work, something else than image and we got "Your image was not uploaded."
Only jpg image work!

When we try to add the extension .jpg to any file, the upload work the file validation don't check file mime type...

We try to fake the file Content-Type with the type field in CURL (https://gist.github.com/z11i/fdd874573fc4956c3ee3aad164eddbfe)

Try this curl request :

curl -i -X POST -F Upload=Upload -F "uploaded=@test.php;type=image/jpg" http://[host]:80/?page=upload | grep flag

We got it :)

Check the file mime type and the extension in both and never execute user file on server!
