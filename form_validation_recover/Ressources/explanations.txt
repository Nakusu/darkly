In the page recover, the hidden input "mail" is present

<input type="hidden" name="mail" value="webmaster@borntosec.com" maxlength="15">

When we execute the form, we got a post request with two fields "mails" and "Submit".

Let's try to change the mail field content!

curl 'http://192.168.1.140:8080/?page=recover' --data-raw 'mail=hibou%40gmail.com&Submit=Submit' | grep flag

We got the flag ;)

Another time, don't trust user at all. Don't put backend logic into frontend.
